This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn start` or `npm run start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br>
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br>
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `yarn build` or `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder, which indicates to (`{root project}/src/main/resource`).<br>
After building the app using this script, you should change the src at the file of {sign.html}, such as replacing `../../main/resources/static/` to the blank.
 
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br>
Your app is ready to be deployed!
